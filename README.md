# SCHENGEN VISA CALCULATOR

This is a basic Schengen Visa calculator that users can use to calculate the amount of days they spent in the Schengen Area within a 90 day period. 

# BACKGROUND 

Citizens of many nations are allowed up to 90 days of free travel within Europe's border-free Schengen Zone. The 90 days of free travel can be confusing, since it is calculated on a rolling basis over the past 180 days. However, for people frequently moving in and out of Schengen Zone countries, it can be difficult to keep track of the total days. They stayed. This app allows users to calcualte the days they stayed in the Schgen Area within a 180 day period.

# FUNCTIONALITY 

The application updates user days automatically and the interactive calendar does not allow users to input days more than 180 days in the past. This is to ensure that users are not calcualting dates that would not count towards their visas.

The application also accoutns for inherent JavaScript calculation of dates which do not count the entry and exit dates that the Schengen Area does. For example, entering a Schengen Area country on December 1 and leaving December 6 would be counted as 6 total days in the Schengen Zone since both entry and exit dates are counted as full days. The application accounts for this.
